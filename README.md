# Global debt analysis, understanding proportion and trend each country

The main goal of this project is to "snapshot" and understand the global debt landscape using data. You'll not only find out who owes the most, but also analyze how heavy that debt burden is for a country and how it's trending over time.

Dataset used in this EDA are from
[worldbank-dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/)
